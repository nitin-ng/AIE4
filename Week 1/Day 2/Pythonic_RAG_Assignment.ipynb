This phenomenon occurs because the CEO may struggle to let go of the function that initially contributed to their success, leading them to choose subpar talent in order to feel superior or more capable. This term is named after Michael Eisner, the former CEO of Disney, who, despite his background as a successful TV network executive, faced challenges when he acquired ABC, leading to its decline in performance.\",\n",
